# MyFirstOnlineGame

# Setup:

install raylib and connect winsock.


Please note:


On the client project raylib and winsock have some conflicts which can be solved by refactoring the raylib header file

# TODOS

1) implement average response time so that frequency of messages isnt only dependant on past response time *DONE*

2) move player based on vector (+1,-1) etc. instead of coordinates to have a consistant buffer size *IN PROGRESS*

3) add a "world environment" class to the server file and get started on the actual game loop
